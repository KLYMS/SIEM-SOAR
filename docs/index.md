# Tutorial: soc-automation

The **soc-automation** project is a *Security Operations Center (SOC) automation platform* that integrates multiple security tools (**Wazuh**, **Graylog**, **TheHive**, etc.) into a cohesive system. It acts like an *orchestrator* to manage security monitoring, logging, and incident response workflows. Key features include **centralized logging**, **threat detection**, **automated response**, and **visual dashboards**, all secured with proper certificate management and network isolation.
